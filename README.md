# Sign-Up Component
A sign-up form component developed with React with client-side validation using JavaScript. 
Styled using CSS components, enforced styles and syntax with ESLint. Added some backend functionality with a json-server.

### Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
